# Configuartion Management Assignment 02

Our solution to the assignment 02 for the course Configuration Management. 

## Short Overview

This project is based upon the following project: https://github.com/michaelulm/software-configuration-management/tree/master/test-automation/junit5/Queue
Our goal is to find the three mistakes hiding in the code, correct them and 
create a new implementation for queue for generics. Further, we will implement 
tests for StringQueue as well as the generic version until we reach 100% test
coverage. In doing so we will update this repository and the task list.
