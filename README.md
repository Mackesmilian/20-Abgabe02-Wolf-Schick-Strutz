# Configuration Management Assignment 02

Our solution to the assignment 02 for the course Configuration Management. 

# Short Overview

This project is based upon the following project: https://github.com/michaelulm/software-configuration-management/tree/master/test-automation/junit5/Queue
Our goal is to find the three mistakes hiding in the code, correct them and 
create a new implementation for queue for generics. Further, we will implement 
tests for StringQueue as well as the generic version until we reach 100% test
coverage. In doing so we will update this repository and the task list.

# Task List

- [x] Invite collaborators
- [x] Create basic project structure
- [x] Add provided code
- [x] Create basic project structure
- [x] Find first mistake
- [x] Find second mistake
- [x] Find third mistake
- [x] Finish all implementations
- [x] Finish test classes
- [ ] Finish JavaDoc comments
- [x] Maven Targets clean, validate, compile, test no errors/warnings
- [ ] Finish Maven Site Documentation
- [ ] Finish Lab Report
- [ ] Add Avatars to pom.xml
